\section{Regression modeling approach}

\subsection{Regression model form}
We consider a hierarchical regression model that estimates effects of clone, genet, source type, as well as the environmental effects of garden plot and garden type, on focal plant phenotypes:

%%%% eq1
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
y^{k}_{j(i)} = \alpha^{k}_{j(i)} + \beta^{k}_{l}\\
\end{equation}

The response variable $y^{k}_{j(i)}$ is the plant trait we wish to model, for clone $i$ nested within genet $j$ from source type $k$. The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. 1 collects all of the constitutive effects, while the second term models the environmental effects of growth in different common gardens. (Note that superscripts $k$ denote group-level indexes and are \emph{not} exponents). We can expand the constitutive effects terms as follows:

%%%% eq2
\begin{equation} \label{eq2}
\alpha^{k}_{j(i)} = \alpha_{j} + \alpha_{1}S_{s} + \varepsilon_{i}
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
\alpha_{j} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\alpha_{0}, \tau^2_{\alpha(j)}) \\
\varepsilon_{i} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2}_{e})
\end{align*}

Eq. 2 captures observation-level residual variance ($\varepsilon_{i}$), among-genet differences ($\alpha_{j}$), and a population-level (i.e. fixed) effect of source type ($\alpha_{1}S_{s}$), where $S_{s}$ is an indicator variable that equals 1 if source type is 'sun' and equals 0 otherwise. Thus, $\alpha_0$ is the population-level intercept for plants derived from shade source habitats measured in shaded gardens (the 'reference' level).

The second term on the right hand side of Eq. 1 captures the effects of environmental variation induced by growth across the six common gardens, as well as the average effect of growing in the sun-type gardens:

%%%% eq3
\begin{equation} \label{eq3}
\beta^{k}_{l} = \beta_{l} + \beta_{1}S_{s}S_{g}
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
\beta_{l} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_{j}S_{g},\tau^2_{\beta(l)}) \\
\beta_{j} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_{0}, \tau^{2}_{\beta(j)})
\end{align*}

Eq. 3 captures plot-to-plot differences among gardens, $\beta_{l}$, which is itself influenced by the main effect of growing in the sun gardens, $\beta_0$, as well as genet-specific effects of growing in sun gardens, $\beta_{j}$. When estimated, this latter term represents a random slope term where the overall slope $\beta_0$ is perturbed with a variance given by $\tau^{2}_{\beta(l)}$. $S_g$ is an indicator variable that equals 1 if the common garden plot is in the sun and 0 if it is in the shade. Thus, $\beta_l$ is constructed so that the expected value ($\beta_{j}S_{g}$) equals 0 in shade gardens, contributing only plot-to-plot level effects given by the variance term $\tau^2_{\beta(l)}$. $\beta_0$ estimates the population-level (main) effect of growth in sun gardens, while $\beta_{1}S_{s}S_{g}$ captures the extent to which sun source plants differ in their response from the main effect $\beta_0$ of growing in the sun, with $S_s$ again indicating source type, as in Eq. 2 above. For all focal plant traits, we initially consider a reduced model where we remove the random slope effect for genet, simplifying the structure of $\beta_{l}$ and estimating one fewer parameter ($\tau^2_{\beta(j)}$):
$$\beta_{l} \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_0S_{g},\tau^2_{\beta(l)})$$

Models were fit via restricted maximum likelihood with and without this term and compared with a likelihood ratio test.

To summarize, the population-level terms to be estimated are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\alpha_0$: Intercept-level term for shade source plants in shade gardens.
\item $\alpha_1$: Effect of source type = sun on constitutive phenotype.
\item $\beta_0$: Average main effect of sun garden on phenotype for shade-derived plants.
\item $\beta_1$: Differential effect of sun gardens when source type = sun (source type $\times$ garden type interaction).
\end{itemize}

The group-level terms to be estimated are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tau^2_{\alpha(j)}$: genet-level variance in constitutive intercept; single term for both source types ($n = 18$ genets).
\item $\tau^2_{\beta(l)}$: garden plot-level variance in phenotype ($n=6$ garden plots in total)
\item $\tau^2_{\beta(j)}$: In the fully parameterized model, this term estimates the magnitude of the among-genet variance in the response to growing in sun gardens. In the reduced form, this term is not estimated.
\item $\sigma^2_{e}$: i.i.d observation- (i.e. clone-) level residual variance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Addition of covariates}

We including trait covariates into our models to control for underlying differences in correlated characters as well as to test whether a main effect of source habitat manifests as different quantitative relationships between traits (e.g. leaf mass vs. leaf area), rather than simply a difference in the average location of residuals once a covariate is taken into account. Thus, we estimate additional $\gamma_{w}$ parameters for each level of the relevant source habitats and/or garden types. In these cases, our model for the effect of a covariate $x_i$ on phenotype $y$ becomes (dropping the $w$ subscript for simplicity):


%%%% eq. 4
\begin{equation} \label{eq4}
y^{k}_{j(i)} = \gamma^{k}_{g} x_{i} + \alpha^{k}_{j(i)} + \beta^{k}_{l}
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
\gamma^{k}_{g} = \gamma_{0} + \gamma_{1}S_{g} + \gamma_{2}S_{s} + \gamma_{12}S_{g}S_{s}
\end{align*}

where $\gamma_{0}$ is the overall slope for shade-source plants measured in shade gardens, $\gamma_{1}$ is the difference in the slope when the $S_{g}$ garden-type indicator variable equals 1, $\gamma_{2}$ is the difference in the slope when the $S_s$ source-type indicator variable equals 1, and $\gamma_{12}$ is the difference when the product $S_{g}S_{s}$ equals 1 (i.e. a three-way interaction term). When only $\gamma_0$ appears in the model, this term is the average value of the covariate across all plants and not just for the reference level.

\subsection{Untransformed traits}
\subsubsection{Trait distributions}
Below we present the distributions of, and correlations between, raw trait data for plant size as indicated by number of leaves ('leaf number'), leaf dry mass (g), leaf area (cm$^2$), and petiole length (mm), as well as the results from an analysis of each trait without accounting for underlying differences in plant size or leaf mass. Such an analysis is meant to quantify 'face-value' differences and not to compare investment in petiole elongation nor leaf expansion, which we deal with in detail in the main text.

The content in this section relates to analyses of focal plant traits where relevant covariates were considered, in addition to cases where response variables and covariates had been transformed via orthogonalization by linear regression with our metric of plant size (log leaf number) and leaf mass (log g dry mass) (see Methods).

\subsection{Analysis of plant size and leaf mass}

\subsubsection{Leaf number} Using log transformed values (unless otherwise noted), we tested for effects of source habitat and garden habitat on plant vegetative traits. Of these, sun-source plants had 40\% more leaves than shade-source plants in both sun and shade gardens (Fig. 1A, $\alpha_{1}= 0.17 [0.05, 0.28]$, $p < 0.05$, Table 1; overall source effect $p=0.005$, Table 3), and plants from both source habitats had nearly twice as many leaves in sun gardens as they did in shade gardens ($\beta_{0} = 0.39 [0.23, 0.55]$, $p<0.001$, Table 1; overall garden effect $p=0.008$, Table 3). We tested for but detected no interaction between source and garden type, and this term was dropped from the reported model with no change in coefficient estimates or in the estimated $R^{2}_{m}$ of the marginal model, which remained at ~40\% (Table 1). Post-hoc comparisons of all source and garden contrasts can be found in Fig. S8.

\subsubsection{Leaf mass} Using log transformed values (unless otherwise noted), we next assessed whether investment in dry mass of the largest leaf, as a function of plant size (leaf number) and garden type, varied between source types (see Fig. S6A for plots of hypothesized covariate interactions). We found that leaf number positively predicted leaf mass similarly across source and garden types ($\gamma_{0} = 0.51 [0.4, 0.6]$, $p<0.001$, Table 1). Importantly, the way plants invested in leaf mass in sun and shade gardens differed by source type (source $\times$ garden overall effect $p=0.003$, Table 3). Specifically, when grown in shade gardens, sun-source plants had a marginally significant 28\% increase in leaf mass over shade-source plants (Fig 1B), independent of leaf number ($\alpha_{1} = 0.11 [0.01, 0.21]$, $0.05\leq p<0.1$, Table 1; see Fig. S8B for plot of marginal effects). In sun gardens, plants of both sources did not differ (post-hoc comparison $p>0.05$, Fig. S8). Accordingly, the higher leaf mass in sun gardens was less extreme for sun-source compared to shade-source plants, decreasing from from 2.5-fold to 1.7-fold (~30\%) ($\beta_{1}= -0.16 [-0.26, -0.05]$, $p<0.001$, Table 1). Fixed effects explained $>60\%$ of the variation in the data for the model of leaf mass reported in Table 1.

\subsection{Glucosinolates}
\subsubsection{Weighted pooling approach}
Glucosinolate (GSL) concentrations were pooled into three distinct chemical classes, designated as IYG and OYG, which refer to GSL compounds yielding isothiocyanates (IYG) or oxazolidine-2-thiones (OYG) upon tissue disruption, as determined in bittercress by Louda and Rodman (1983a) and Rodman and Louda (1985). $m/z$ is the mass-to-charge ratio of the GSL precursor ions quantified in this study. Retention time (RT) indicates the time in minutes when peak intensity of a given compound was observed. GSL concentrations were quantified as parent ion counts per gram of wet leaf material and multiplied by the weighting factors given below (Table S6) to obtain approximate relative abundances (i.e., mg of focal IYG compound per mg total IYG; see Methods).

Three peaks with  $m/z = 390$, the parent ion corresponding to 1-(hydroxymethyl)propyl GSL, were observed (Table S6). 1-(hydroxymethyl)propyl GSL could not be definitively assigned to a single peak using our methods. Because intensities of the three peaks were correlated across samples, the peak at RT = 7.3 mins (which achieved high chromatographic resolution) was used for quantification of 1-(hydroxymethyl)propyl GLS parent ion counts. 2-(hydroxymethyl)propyl GSL, another compound with $m/z = 390$, was previously identified in bittercress (Louda and Rodman 1983a). However, because the non-hydroxylated form of this GSL is present at relatively low amounts, we did not quantify this compound in this study.

Post-hoc contrasts indicate elevated IYG for sun-source plants relative to shade-source plants in shade gardens. This was driven by opposite effects of shading on IYG for each source type: sun-source plants accumulated more IYG, and shade-source plants accumulated less, in shade gardens compared to sun gardens. \textbf{C}. Marginal effects plot showing covariate interaction between (log) g wet leaf mass and indole concentration, revealing that sun and shade source plants exhibited contrasting patterns of indole concentration as a function of leaf mass.

%%%% SECTION 5 %%%%

\subsection{Model form}
We estimated coefficients in a hierarchical regression model of the following form:

%%%% eq5
\begin{equation} \label{eq5}
y^{g}_{kji} = \alpha^{g}_{kj} + \beta S_{l} + \gamma x_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
\alpha^{g}_{kj} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\alpha_{kj}, \tau^{2}_{g})\\
\alpha_{kj} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\alpha_0 + \alpha_{j}, \tau^2_{k}) \\
\alpha_{j} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau^2_{j}) \\
\varepsilon_{i} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2}_{e})
\end{align*}

Where $y^{g}_{kji}$ is the trait measure (either log cm$^2$ leaf area or mm petiole length) of leaf $i$ from position $j$ from plant $k$ from genetic family $g$. $\alpha_0$ is the intercept of the reference level (shade environment), $\beta$ is the slope of the average response to growth in elevated FR:R light ('sun'), where $S_{l}$ is an indicator variable for light environment that equals $0$ in simulated shade and $1$ in the sun environment. Finally, $\gamma$ is the slope of the increase in petiole length per unit increase in the value of covariate $x$. We model variation among families, among plants (nested within family), and among leaf positions as a series of group-level (i.e. random) effects, similar to Eqs. 1 and 4 above. Our model of leaf area did not include estimation of a $\gamma$ covariate term.
